        <h1>Welcomte to Kep </h1>

        <img src="img/kep.jpg" title="###" width="1000">

        <p>This is a relaxing southwestern seaside province situated 168 Km away from Phnom Penh. Besides the beaches, Kep is best known for having the best pepper, salt and seafood, especially crabs.</p>
        <p>Several islands, including the popular Rabbit Island (Koh Thonsáy), lay just a short boat ride off its coast.
            This coastal province is one of the ‘must visits’ when in Cambodia.
            Crabs fried with pepper - a local specialty dish.
        </p>
        <p>Freshly caught crabs are sorted according to size
            and usually sold even before they are brought to shore.
